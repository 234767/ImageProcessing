\section{Description of the implementation of \texorpdfstring{\\ }{} histogram-based image enhancement method}
Histogram based image enhancements work by assigning new values to the luminosity levels, to match the histogram to some function.
The old luminosities will be denoted as $f$, and the new ones, as $g$.
The histogram of the image is denoted as $H$, and $H(f)$ means the number of pixels with luminosity $f$.
Finally, $N$ will mean the total number of pixels in the image.

\subsection{Mathematical description}

The equation for calculating the new luminosity values were given as:
\begin{equation}
    g(f) = g_{min} +\sqrt{
        2 \alpha^2 \cdot \ln\left[
            \left(
            \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{k=0}^f H(k)
            \right)^{-1}
            \right]
    }
    \label{eq:rayleigh-initial}
\end{equation}

We immediately noticed, that the numer under the logarithm is a partial sum of the normalized histogram values for luminosities smaller or equal $f$.
We can refactor the equation, by introducing a partial sum function $ps(f)$:
\begin{equation}
    ps(f) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^f H(f)
\end{equation}

Equation (\ref{eq:rayleigh-initial}) then takes form:
\begin{equation}
    g(f) = g_{min} + \sqrt{
        2 \alpha^2 \cdot \ln
        \left(
        \frac{N}{ps(f)}
        \right)}
\end{equation}

Note that,
\(
\forall_{f \in [f_{min},f_{max}]} : 0 < ps(f) \leq N
\), and $ps(f)$ is monotinically non-decreasing.
That means that $\frac{N}{ps(f)}$ is monotinically non-increasing, and as follows, $g(f)$ is also non-increasing.

However, this is not what we want from image transformation, as it would produce a negative image.
Therefore, we flip the function horizontally, by changing the sign of $ps(f)$, and offseting it by $N$, to keep the domain the same.

\begin{equation}
    g(f) = g_{min} + \sqrt{
        2 \alpha^2 \cdot \ln
        \left(
        \frac{N}{N - ps(f) + 1}
        \right)}
    \label{eq:rayleigh-corrected}
\end{equation}
Now, as $f$ increases, $g(f)$ will increase as well.

However, the value of $\alpha$ is still unknown.
We know, that the function $g(f)$ should map $f$ to $g$ in such a way, that
$f_{min} \mapsto g_{min}$ and $f_{max} \mapsto g_{max}$.

For the first case:
\(
\lim\limits_{f \to f_{min}} ps(f) = 1
\),which means that
\(
\lim\limits_{f \to f_{min}} g(f) = g_{min}
\) regardless of $\alpha$.

The second case is more interesting:
\begin{align*}
    ps(f_{max}) & = N                \\[1ex]
    g(f_{max})  & = g_{min} + \sqrt{
        2 \alpha^2 \cdot \ln(N)
    }
\end{align*}
Substituting $g(f_{max}) = g_{max}$,
\begin{align}
    g_{max} & = g_{min} + \sqrt{
        2 \alpha^2 \cdot \ln(N)
    }\nonumber                                                                     \\[1ex]
    g_{max} & = g_{min} + \alpha \cdot \sqrt{2\ln(N)} \nonumber                    \\[1ex]
    \alpha  & = \frac{g_{max} - g_{min}}{\sqrt{2\ln(N)}} \label{eq:rayleigh-alpha}
\end{align}
